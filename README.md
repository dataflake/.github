Templates used for all repos which do not provide these files

* The file ``CONTRIBUTING.md`` from this repository is used for every
  zopefoundation repository which does not have its own version.

* Files in the ``.github/ISSUE_TEMPLATE`` folder are used as templates when
  creating a bug tracker issue. (The nested ``.github`` folder is due to a
  GitHub bug)

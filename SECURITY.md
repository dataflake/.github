# Security Policy

## Reporting a Vulnerability
Please do **NOT** create a public bug report if you think you found a security
issue. Instead, please contact me directly via email: jens@dataflake.org.

Only bug reports submitted directly to me will be treated as responsible
disclosure. Any offered for sale to third parties or submitted to public bug
bounty programmes will be treated as irresponsible public disclosure. I will
not confirm any submissions on third party platforms such as "huntr" or
"hackerone" and do not give permission for those systems to accept reports on
my behalf or to represent themselves as a conduit for vulnerability reports.
